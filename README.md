# Global-Literacy-Project-2
The Global Literacy Analysis project examines the relationship between literacy rates, gender gaps in education, average years of schooling, and GDP per capita across countries over multiple years.
Analyze adult and youth literacy trends over time
Compare male vs female literacy rates
Identify countries with high gender gaps
Study correlation between GDP per capita and literacy
Detect countries with high schooling years but persistent illiteracy

  Created a power Bi visualization to get deeper insights as below
  
The literacy growth trend shows that before 2000s there is very minimal growth and had low literacy rate. At the end of 20th century we see a sudden spike in literacy and then a sudden fall after 2000s but the peak has been in improving standards. 
In most countries  Youth literacy > Adult literacy. This suggests that Education has been prioritized over time, and has been provided with improved policies and standards.
Older generations had limited access historically. Although Educational reforms are working, but generational gaps remain.
Younger generations are benefiting from expanded education systems.
Impacted country : Africa - which has been improved with high youth literacy after 2000. But remains with low literacy rate when compared with developed and some developing countries. 

Gender wise Literacy shows that Male and female literacy are more or less improving in same standards and has very low variance.
Overall Global improvement of literacy rate among Male and women are kept improving region wise. 

In the below chart, we can visualize the correlation between the literacy rate and GDP, where both the variables moves positively and in same pace. 
Country wise analysis shows that higher GDP has highest literacy rate, thus GDP impacts the literacy growth among countries. But still there are few countries Although GDP is high but still shows low literacy rate because of economic growth, average years of schooling and other factors we explored before.
Economic development strongly influences education access and quality.
